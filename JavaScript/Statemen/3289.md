[3289\. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-two-sneaky-numbers-of-digitville/)


In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called `nums` containing integers from `0` to `n - 1`. Each number was supposed to appear **exactly once** in the list, however, **two** mischievous numbers sneaked in an _additional time_, making the list longer than usual.

As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size **two** containing the two numbers (in _any order_), so peace can return to Digitville.
